    "   - I queried the Pokémon database to retrieve relevant information such as Pokémon types, abilities, stats, height, and weight.\n",

    "2. **Data Visualization:**\n",
    "   - Several visualizations were created to provide insights into the dataset:\n",
    "     - A **bar chart** for the most common Pokémon types.\n",
    "     - A **scatter plot** for the distribution of height and weight among Pokémon.\n",
    "     - A **bar chart** for the average values of Pokémon stats.\n",
    "     - A **table** displaying the strongest Pokémon based on the sum of their stats.\n",

    "3. **Key Findings:**\n",
    "   - The most common Pokémon types were determined, showcasing the popularity of specific types in the Pokémon universe.\n",
    "   - The average stats for different categories like HP, Attack, Defense, etc., provided an understanding of typical Pokémon attributes.\n",
    "   - The strongest Pokémon, based on their stats, were identified, showing the most powerful Pokémon in terms of stat sums.\n",
